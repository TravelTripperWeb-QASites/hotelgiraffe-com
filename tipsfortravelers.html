         <p

Each floor in our hotel has the same room layout, so depending on which room you have booked also determines which street you are facing. Although our first priority is to accommodate your room type, we keep in mind your request for a quiet room or a high floor. Since we are a small hotel or only 72 rooms and 11 sleeping room floors, please do not be disappointed if we cannot fulfill all requests.</p>

      <div
         class="post-txt">
         <p
            novaref=344601 novatype=multi>Guests must provide a credit card to the hotel at time of check in to guarantee the hotel charges. We recommend you do not use a debit card for this. When you arrive and register, we must get authorization approval from your bank or card issuer for the amount equal to the room and taxes due for the stay as well as an additional $100 per day to allow for incidental charges during your stay such as phone service, room service, valet service and more.</p>
         <p
            novaref=344601 novatype=multi>A hold may be placed on your card account for the full authorized amount, through your date of check-out and such hold may not be released for 72 hours from the date of check-out or longer at the discretion of your card issuer. Our tip for travelers is whether you stay with us or at any other hotel, please be sure before your stay to secure a credit limit on your card that will comfortably allow for your room and taxes as well as the pre-authorization for incidentals plus all the shopping and activities you’ll want to enjoy in NYC.</p>
         <p
            novaref=344601 novatype=multi>Prepaying your stay before you arrive will get you the best rate on our website and will also limit the amount we authorize to just the $100 per day for incidentals. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at information@hotelgiraffe.com or visit our Tips For Travelers blog for more information on Credit Procedures: http://www.libraryhotelcollection.com/blog/?p=43</p>
